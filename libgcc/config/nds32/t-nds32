# Note:
#   Because GCC has its own make rules for crtbegin.o and crtend.o,
#   we cannot use crtbegin.o and crtend.o rules.
#   So we create crtbegin1.o and crtend1.o instead.
#   Make sure the linker script include these two objects
#   for building .ctors/.dtors sections.

# Use -DCRT_BEGIN to create beginning parts of .init and .fini content.
crtbegin1.o: $(srcdir)/config/nds32/initfini.c $(GCC_PASSES) $(CONFIG_H)
	$(GCC_FOR_TARGET) $(INCLUDES) \
	$(CFLAGS) \

	-finhibit-size-directive -fno-inline-functions \
	-fno-toplevel-reorder \
	-Os -c $(srcdir)/config/nds32/initfini.c -o crtbegin1.o

# Use -DCRT_END to create ending parts of .init and .fini content.
crtend1.o: $(srcdir)/config/nds32/initfini.c $(GCC_PASSES) $(CONFIG_H)
